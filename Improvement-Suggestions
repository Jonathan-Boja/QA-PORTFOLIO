Suggested Improvement

Make the address text clickable so that it redirects users to the Contact Us section/page, where the shop’s map location is available.

Expected Improvement

Users can quickly view the shop’s location by clicking the address, making navigation easier and more intuitive.

Impact / Benefit

Easier navigation for customers

Better usability and user convenience

Improves trust and professionalism of the website

Website Tested:
https://www.helmetprosolutions.com/

Type:
UI/UX Improvement / Enhancement

Severity / Threat Level:
Low

Current Behavior

The Login button text is displayed as “LogIn”, which uses inconsistent capitalization. This makes the text look slightly unpolished and visually off.

Suggested Improvement

Change the button text from “LogIn” to “Login” or “Log in” to follow standard UI text conventions and improve visual consistency.

Expected Improvement

The button will appear more professional and easier to read, improving overall user experience.

Impact / Benefit

Cleaner and more professional UI

Better readability

Improved user perception of website quality

#4 Title

Numeric Input Fields Force Leading Zero

Website Tested:
https://www.helmetprosolutions.com/

Type:
UI/UX Improvement / Enhancement

Severity / Threat Level:
Medium

Current Behavior

Numeric input fields are pre-filled with 0, and the value cannot be fully deleted. When users type a number, the input always keeps the leading zero (e.g., 090, 0100). Although calculations are not affected, the behavior feels confusing and unpolished.

Suggested Improvement

Allow users to fully clear the input field or automatically replace the default 0 when typing. Alternatively, remove the default 0 and use placeholder text instead.

Expected Improvement

Inputs will behave naturally, improving clarity and user confidence when entering values.

Impact / Benefit

Better user experience

More natural data entry behavior

Cleaner and more professional UI
